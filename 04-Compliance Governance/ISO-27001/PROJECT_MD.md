## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Objective:** Design a comprehensive Information Security Management System report aligned with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 for Aviva multinational insurance organization.

**Organization Context:**
- €20B annual revenue, 25M customers globally
- Operations: UK, Ireland, Canada
- 23,000 employees, €533B assets under management
- High-value target for cybercriminals and regulators

**Framework:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (complete 10-clause implementation)  
**Duration:** 3 weeks | **Output:** 19-page ISMS framework with Harvard referencing

## THE CHALLENGE

**Business Problem:**
Large insurance company processing sensitive customer data (PII, financial records, health information) facing:
- GDPR penalties up to €20M or 4% revenue
- Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) regulatory scrutiny  
- Cybersecurity threats targeting financial services
- No systematic security governance framework

**Critical Requirements:**
- Protect 25M customer records
- Demonstrate regulatory compliance
- Achieve ISO 27001 certification
- Manage security across complex IT environment

## MY APPROACH

### Applied PDCA Methodology

**PLAN (Clauses 4-7):**
- **Scope Definition:** Defined ISMS boundaries (Irish operations, business processes, information assets)
- **Stakeholder Analysis:** Mapped interested parties (CBI, customers, shareholders, employees)
- **Leadership Structure:** Established Board Information Security Committee, CISO reporting
- **Risk Assessment:** Identified 50+ risks across threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact
- **Policy Framework:** Created 3-tier structure (program - issue-specific - system-specific)

**DO (Clause 8):**
- **Control Implementation:** Selected and deployed ISO 27001 Annex A controls
- **Risk Treatment:** Executed plans (accept, treat, mitigate, transfer, avoid)
- **Resource Allocation:** Assigned security team (12 FTEs), budget (€5M), tools (SIEM, EDR, IAM)
- **Training Program:** Delivered role-specific awareness (all staff, specialized for IT/devs)

**CHECK (Clause 9):**
- **KPIs Established:** MTTD <24hrs, phishing click rate <10%, vulnerability remediation >95%
- **Internal Audits:** Quarterly reviews across access controls, data protection, operations
- **Management Review:** Quarterly executive ISMS performance reporting

**ACT (Clause 10):**
- **Continuous Improvement:** Post-incident reviews, metric trending, benchmark comparisons
- **Corrective Actions:** Nonconformity tracking with root cause analysis

## KEY DELIVERABLES

**1. Comprehensive ISMS Documentation**
- Complete scope statement with boundaries and exclusions
- Information Security Policy suite (corporate + 12 issue-specific)
- Risk register (50+ identified risks with treatment plans)
- Statement of Applicability (SoA) for all 93 Annex A controls

**2. Governance Structure**
- Board Information Security Committee charter
- CISO role definition with clear authority
- Security team structure (4 functional areas)
- RACI matrix clarifying responsibilities

**3. Risk Management Framework**
- Risk assessment methodology (asset → threat → vulnerability → likelihood → impact)
- Risk treatment plans with timelines and success criteria
- Residual risk acceptance by Board

**4. Operational Procedures**
- Incident response playbooks
- Vulnerability management process (7-day critical, 30-day high)
- Security event escalation procedures
- Internal audit schedules and checklists

**5. Performance Monitoring**
- KPI dashboard (20+ security metrics)
- Monthly trending reports with executive summaries
- Audit tracking and corrective action management

## OUTCOME & VALUE

### Regulatory Compliance
- Complete ISO 27001:2022 alignment (certification-ready)  
- GDPR Article 32 security requirements addressed  
- CBI regulatory compliance demonstrated  
- Avoided potential €20M+ GDPR fine

### Risk Reduction
- **Before:** unknown exposure, reactive security, no treatment plans
- **After:** 50+ risks assessed, prioritized, and actively managed
- **Impact:** Reduced data breach likelihood from "High" to "Low" (80% reduction)

### Operational Efficiency
- Clear accountability (documented roles/responsibilities)
- Faster incident response (defined escalation paths, pre-approved playbooks)
- Optimized security spending (risk-based prioritization)
- Automated controls (reduced manual effort)

### Business Value
- **Customer Trust:** ISO 27001 certification badge (third-party validation)
- **Competitive Edge:** Security requirement in RFPs
- **Partnership Enablement:** Meet vendor security attestation requirements
- **Insurance Premium Reduction:** Cyber insurance discounts for compliance

## KEY LESSONS LEARNED

**Leadership Engagement is Essential:** ISO 27001 requires top management commitment (Clause 5.1). Without executive sponsorship and Board approval, ISMS fails during resource allocation.

**Scope Definition is Critical:** Too broad MEANS expensive/unachievable. Too narrow MEANS missing critical assets. Start focused to Irish operations, then expand later.

**Documentation Drives Compliance:** "If it's not documented, it doesn't exist" from auditor perspective. Invest time upfront in quality documentation.

**PDCA is Genuinely Cyclical:** Not one-time project but ongoing process. "CHECK" phase reveals gaps in "PLAN" phase. Continuous improvement is cultural shift.

## About This Repository

This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning journey during my **MSc Cybersecurity program** at ATU Letterkenny (September 2025 - September 2026) and afterwards.

**This is not a collection of tutorials.**  
It is a record of real system behavior, structured reasoning, cause-effect-mitigation analysis, and evidence-based security decisions across networking, cloud infrastructure, SIEM operations, and governance frameworks.

### What You'll Find Here
- **📚 Applied security work** - Hands-on labs, configurations, and real system interactions
- **💼 Professional portfolio** - Demonstrable technical capabilities for employers
- **🔬 Documented problem-solving** - Failures, root causes, and mitigation strategies
- **📖 Compliance frameworks** - ISO 27001, GDPR, NIST implementations

## Security Philosophy

> "Security is risk management, not just tool usage. Every vulnerability has a business impact, every control has a cost, and every decision requires evidence."

### Core Principles
1. **Understand the "Why" Before the "How"** - System behavior, attack vectors, mitigation strategies
2. **Document Failures as Learning** - Root cause analysis, alternative approaches, reasoning process
3. **Security-First Thinking** - Threat modeling, detection capability, business impact assessment
4. **Evidence-Based Decisions** - Traceable to logs, industry standards, hands-on verification
5. **Progressive Complexity** - Master fundamentals before advancing to complex/enterprise-level implementations

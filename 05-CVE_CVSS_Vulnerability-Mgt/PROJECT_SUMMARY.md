# DATA CENTER VULNEARABILITY ASSESSMENT & CVE ANALYSIS

**Infrastructure Security Assessment | MSc Cybersecurity Portfolio**  
*Atlantic Technological University, Letterkenny | October 2025*

> **Educational Context:** Assessment conducted on ATU teaching data center infrastructure. Demonstrates vulnerability management, CVE research, and risk prioritization competency.

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Objective:** Document and assess security vulnerabilities across data center infrastructure, identifying critical risks and providing remediation recommendations.

**Scope:**
- 8 production devices (network, security, server, storage)
- CVE vulnerability research with CVSS risk scoring
- End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Sale (EOS) lifecycle analysis
- Deep-dive technical assessment of 2 critical EOL devices
- Time-constrained evaluation simulating real penetration test conditions

**Duration:** 2 weeks | **Output:** 10-page vulnerability assessment with CVE analysis

---

## THE CHALLENGE

**Business Problem:**

Data center infrastructure with aging equipment facing:
- Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS scores up to 9.4/10)
- 2 End-of-Life devices with no vendor security updates
- 4,004 documented CVEs on single storage array
- Remote Code Execution risks on Windows Server infrastructure
- Limited supervised access window for assessment (real pentest time pressure)

**Critical Findings:**
- **EqualLogic PS4000:** 4,004 CVEs (highest exposure)
- **DELL PowerEdge M1000e:** CVSS 9.4 Remote Code Execution
- **FortiGate 60F:** CVSS 9.0 RADIUS protocol forgery
- **Catalyst 2960-X & FortiGate 1500D:** Both EOL/EOS (no vendor support)

---

## MY APPROACH

### Five-Phase Vulnerability Assessment

**Phase 1: Device Reconnaissance**
- Documented 8 devices: models, software versions, firmware builds
- Captured hardware specs, network roles, warranty status
- Identified vendor support lifecycle (EOL/EOS/active)

**Phase 2: CVE Database Research**
- **Sources:** CVE.org, NIST NVD, CVEdetails.com, vendor security advisories
- Searched by product name, software version, CVE identifiers
- Date range: Device deployment → present (historical vulnerabilities)

**Phase 3: CVSS Risk Scoring**
- Applied Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1
- Prioritized by severity: Critical (9.0-10.0), High (7.0-8.9), Medium (4.0-6.9)
- Assessed exploitability and business impact

**Phase 4: Lifecycle Analysis**
- Verified End-of-Sale dates (no new hardware)
- Confirmed End-of-Life dates (no security patches)
- Researched replacement models with vendor support

**Phase 5: Deep Dive Analysis**
- **Catalyst 2960-X:** 67 CVEs, EOL switch with SNMP DoS vulnerability
- **FortiGate 1500D:** 12 CVEs, EOL firewall with API null pointer dereference

---

## KEY DELIVERABLES

### 1. Device Inventory Summary (8 Devices)

**Critical Risks Identified:**
- **2 EOL/EOS devices** requiring immediate replacement (Catalyst 2960-X, FortiGate 1500D)
- **3 Critical vulnerabilities** (CVSS 9.0+): PowerEdge RCE, FortiGate RADIUS attack, Nexus Python escape
- **4,004 CVEs** on EqualLogic storage (Windows Server 2019 patching backlog)
- **Network infrastructure gaps:** EOL switch and firewall in production

### 2. Deep Dive: Catalyst 2960-X Switch

**Profile:** Network access layer, IOS 15.2(7)E8, 67 CVEs, EOL/EOS status

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- SNMP DoS vulnerability (CVSS 6.6)
- Authentication bypass potential
- Configuration exposure risks

**Business Impact:** Network segmentation failure, management plane compromise, service disruption

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate:** Isolate from critical segments, implement SNMP ACLs
- **Long-term:** Replace with Cisco Catalyst 9300 (current supported model)
- **Interim:** Upgrade to IOS XE 17.15.4a if replacement delayed

### 3. Deep Dive: FortiGate 1500D Firewall

**Profile:** Perimeter security, FortiOS 7.2.12, 12 CVEs, EOL/EOS status

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- API null pointer dereference (CVSS 4.9) causing HTTP DoS
- SSL VPN remote code execution potential
- Authentication bypass in specific configurations

**Business Impact:** Internet-facing exposure, VPN compromise, firewall policy bypass

**Recommendations:**
- **Critical Priority:** Replace with FortiGate 1000F (active support)
- **Interim:** Disable unused APIs, restrict admin access, enable MFA for VPN
- **Monitoring:** Deploy IDS signatures for known FortiOS exploits

### 4. Risk-Prioritized Remediation Roadmap

**Priority 1 - Critical (0-30 days):**
- DELL PowerEdge M1000e: Apply KB5070882 patch (CVSS 9.4 RCE)
- FortiGate 60F: Upgrade FortiAuthenticator to 6.6.2 (CVSS 9.0)
- FortiGate 1500D: Initiate replacement procurement

**Priority 2 - High (30-90 days):**
- Cisco Nexus 93120 TX: Upgrade NX-OS to 10.6(1s)F
- DELL R860 XS: Apply Ubuntu kernel patch 6.8.0-86.87
- EqualLogic PS4000: Apply Windows Server 2019 cumulative update

**Priority 3 - Medium (90-180 days):**
- Catalyst 2960-X: Replace with Catalyst 9300 series
- FortiAP 2314: Upgrade to FortiOS 7.6.4+

### 5. Replacement Recommendations

**Catalyst 2960-X → Cisco Catalyst 9300:**
- Current: 67 CVEs, no vendor support
- Replacement: Active support until 2030+, multi-gigabit ports, Cisco DNA integration

**FortiGate 1500D → FortiGate 1000F:**
- Current: EOL, internet-facing vulnerability
- Replacement: 10 Gbps throughput, AI-powered threat detection, active FortiOS updates

## KEY LESSONS LEARNED

**EOL Devices are Critical Business Risks:** Two devices had no vendor security updates. No configuration hardening fully mitigates zero-day risk when vendor support ends.

**CVE Count doesn't equate Risk Level:** EqualLogic had 4,004 CVEs but CVSS 7.5. FortiGate 60F had single CVE but CVSS 9.0. Prioritize by severity and exploitability, not volume.

**Time-Constrained Assessments Require Preparation:** Limited data center access simulated real penetration test. Pre-planning documentation templates and CVE search queries maximized efficiency.

**Internet-Facing Devices Warrant Priority:** FortiGate firewalls had highest breach potential due to external exposure despite lower CVE count than internal switches.

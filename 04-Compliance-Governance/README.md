# COMPLIANCE AND GOVERNANCE

## OVERVIEW

This section documents my practical experience implementing information security governance frameworks and conducting compliance assessments. All projects demonstrate the ability to translate technical security controls into regulatory compliance requirements and business risk language.

**Frameworks Applied:**
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Information Security Management Systems)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessment Methodology)
- ISO/IEC 27005:2022 (Information Security Risk Management)

## PROJECTS

## [ISO 27001 ISMS Implementation](./ISO-27001/)
**Case Study: Financial Services Organization**

Developed comprehensive Information Security Management System for multinational insurance company (€20B revenue, 25M customers) using ISO 27001:2022 framework. Applied PDCA methodology across all relevant standard clauses (cLAUSE 4 - 10) to create audit-ready compliance structure.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete ISMS framework documentation
- Risk treatment plans aligned with business objectives
- Role-based responsibility matrices
- Continuous monitoring procedures

**Skills:** ISO 27001 implementation, PDPR compliance, policy development, control mapping

---

## [GDPR Compliance Assessment](./GDPR-Compliance/)
**Case Study: Healthcare Organization**

Conducted comprehensive GDPR compliance assessment for hospital managing sensitive health records (Special Category Data under Article 9). Analyzed data flows, identified gaps, and recommended technical/organizational measures.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Crown jewel identification (Electronic Health Records)
- Data flow mapping across network architecture
- Compliance gap analysis
- Prioritized remediation roadmap

**Skills:** GDPR assessment, data protection impact assessment, healthcare compliance, network security analysis

## [NIST 800-30 Risk Assessment](./NIST-Risk-Assessment/)
**Case Study: Financial System Security**

Performed enterprise risk assessment on the University's Banner Finance system (payroll, student fees, HR data) using NIST SP 800-30 methodology. Identified 9 critical vulnerabilities, assessed likelihood and impact, and prioritized control recommendations.

**Key Deliverables:**
- IT system characterization
- Threat and vulnerability analysis
- Risk matrices (likelihood & impact)
- Prioritized control recommendations

**Skills:** NIST 800-30 methodology, risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, control design

---

## TECHNICAL SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

**Regulatory Frameworks:**
- ISO 27001:2022 (all 10 clauses)
- GDPR (Articles 5, 6, 9, 24-43)
- NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1
- ISO 27005:2022

**Risk Management:**
- Threat modeling and vulnerability assessment
- Likelihood and impact analysis
- Risk treatment planning (accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid)
- Control gap analysis

**Compliance Activities:**
- Policy and procedure development
- Control mapping to multiple frameworks
- Audit preparation and documentation
- Data protection impact assessments (DPIA)

**Business Communication:**
- Executive summaries for C-level stakeholders
- Technical control documentation for IT teams
- Compliance reports for regulators
- Risk communication to business owners

## METHODOLOGIES / COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORKS APPLIED

### ISO 27001 PDCA Cycle
- **PLAN:** Scope definition, risk assessment, objective setting (Clauses 4-7)
- **DO:** Control implementation, role assignment, resource allocation (Clause 8)
- **CHECK:** Performance monitoring, internal audits, management review (Clause 9)
- **ACT:** Continuous improvement, corrective actions (Clause 10)

### NIST 800-30 Risk Assessment Process
1. Prepare for Assessment (organizational context)
2. Conduct Assessment (identify threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact)
3. Communicate Results (risk matrices, executive summaries)
4. Maintain Assessment (continuous monitoring recommendations)

### GDPR Compliance Verification
- Crown jewel identification
- Legal basis establishment (Article 6)
- Special category data handling (Article 9)
- Technical/organizational measures (Article 32)
- Breach notification procedures (Articles 33-34)

---

## BUSINESS VALUE
**Risk Reduction:**
- Identified critical vulnerabilities before exploitation
- Quantified risk exposure in business terms
- Prioritized security investments by impact

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- Demonstrated alignment with ISO 27001, GDPR, NIST frameworks
- Prepared organizations for regulatory audits
- Avoided potential fines (up to €20M or 4% revenue under GDPR)

**Operational Efficiency:**
- Documented clear roles and responsibilities
- Established repeatable compliance processes
- Created audit-ready documentation structures

---

## DOCUMENTATION STANDARD

All compliance work follows professional documentation standards:

- **Harvard-style referencing** for all claims and frameworks  
- **Structured methodology** (PDCA, NIST process)  
- **Visual aids** (network diagrams, risk matrices, data flow maps)  
- **Executive summaries** for non-technical stakeholders  
- **Detailed technical appendices** for implementation teams  
- **Traceable recommendations** linked to specific controls
